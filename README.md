# **About <font color="red">Delhivery<font>ðŸšš**

Delhivery is the largest and fastest-growing fully integrated player in India by revenue in Fiscal 2021. They aim to build the operating system for commerce, through a combination of world-class infrastructure, logistics operations of the highest quality, and cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.

The Data team builds intelligence and capabilities using this data that helps them to widen the gap between the quality, efficiency, and profitability of their business versus their competitors.

# **How can you help here?ðŸ‘€**
The company wants to understand and process the data coming out of data engineering pipelines:

ðŸ§¹**Clean, sanitize** and **manipulate data** to get useful features out of raw fields

ðŸ’¡**Make sense out of the raw data** and help the data science team to build forecasting models on it

# **Why this case study?**

**From Delhivery's Perspective:**

- Delhivery aims to establish itself as the premier player in the logistics industry. This
case study is of paramount importance as it aligns with the company's core objectives
and operational excellence.
- It provides a practical framework for understanding and processing data, which is
integral to their operations. By leveraging data engineering pipelines and data analysis
techniques, Delhivery can achieve several critical goals.
- First, it allows them to ensure data integrity and quality by addressing missing values
and structuring the dataset appropriately.
- Second, it enables the extraction of valuable features from raw data, which can be
utilized for building accurate forecasting models.
- Moreover, it facilitates the identification of patterns, insights, and actionable
recommendations crucial for optimizing their logistics operations.
- By conducting hypothesis testing and outlier detection, Delhivery can refine their
processes and further enhance the quality of service they provide.


**From Learners' Perspective:**

- Learners will gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing and cleaning, which is
often the most time-consuming aspect of data analysis.
- Feature engineering is a critical step in building machine learning models. In this case
study, learners will understand how to extract meaningful features from raw data,
including datetime manipulation and column splitting.
- The case study introduces learners to the concept of grouping data based on specific
keys and then aggregating it. This is a key aspect of data analysis, especially when
dealing with time-series data or data with a hierarchical structure.
- Learners will perform hypothesis testing, to validate assumptions and draw insights
from data.
- The case study goes beyond data analysis by focusing on deriving actionable insights
for a business. Learners will understand how data analysis can drive informed
decision-making and recommendations.
